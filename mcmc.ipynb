By combining all of these solutions, an approximation of the most likely answer is yielded with error bars, and the correct answer is likely to be contained within those error bars. A Monte Carlo chain is considered to be Markov if its next \"step\" in parameter space is only dependent on its current position, and not the history of the entire chain.\n","\n","These types of algorithms are usually implemented when scientists are faced with complex models for which other computational approaches are not appropriate. For example, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) may be chosen when a least squares fitting algorithm has difficulty fitting a high-dimensional model with multiple probability wells in the parameter space. It takes a long time to calculate the probability a model is true for provided data at every point in your parameter space, and this will only increase proportionally to the parameter number. MCMC methods are designed to spend time sampling the most likely parameter sets. Also they do not require a full analytic description of the normalised probability density function (pdf) to begin sampling since only the ratios of the pdf at pairs of locations are calculated, making them ideal for calculating _posterior pdfs_.\n","\n","In probabilistic inference, Bayes rule states that the posterior pdf $p\\left(\\theta|D\\right)$ (pdf of parameters $\\theta$ given data $D$) can be determined from the likelihood $p\\left(D|\\theta\\right)$ (pdf of the data given the parameters) and the prior pdf $p\\left(\\theta\\right)$ for the parameters.\n","\n","<center>$p\\left(\\theta|D\\right)=\\frac{1}{Z}p\\left(D|\\theta\\right)p\\left(\\theta\\right)$</center>\n","\n","Here, $Z$ is sometimes referred to as the \"marginalised likelihood\" and is incredibly difficult and computationally expensive to calculate.

The algorithm is as follows:\n","\n","* Draw a proposal of $\\theta^{\\prime}$ from pdf $q\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}|\\theta_{k}\\right)$ (this is usually a Gaussian distribution centred on the current position).\n","* Draw a random number $0<r<1$ from a uniform distribution.\n","* If $p\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}\\right)/p\\left(\\theta_{k}\\right)>r$ then $\\theta_{k+1}\\leftarrow\\theta^{\\prime}$; otherwise $\\theta_{k+1}\\leftarrow\\theta_{k}$.\n","\n","This produces a random walk which is biased by the acceptance step involving the ratios of the function values. The amount of time the algorithm spends around a location $\\theta$ is proportional to $p\\left(\\theta\\right)$ and samples have to be significantly separated along the chain before they are considered independent from each other.

The problems arise when the M-H sampler reaches the ridge of the probability density and need to walk along it until it reaches the peak at (0,0). Now, any small deviation from its current position will result in the sampler falling back into infinitesimal probability space.

Hence if some walkers detect an optimal probability, then more walkers can be brought to the area - and away from any problematic areas - to effectively sample the surrounding parameter space.
